      <h3>What is the Trinity?</h3>
      <p>The doctrine of the Trinity is the central mystery of the Christian faith and life. It 
      teaches that there is one God in three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 
      These are not three gods, nor three aspects of God, but three distinct Persons who share 
      one divine nature. The Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Holy Spirit, and the Holy 
      Spirit is not the Father — yet all are fully and equally God. This is why the Church says 
      God is one in essence, three in Person.

      This mystery is revealed in Scripture, such as at Jesus’ baptism (Matthew 3:16–17), where 
      the Father speaks, the Son is baptized, and the Holy Spirit descends like a dove. Jesus 
      also commands the apostles to baptize “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of 
      the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19). The Trinity is not a logical puzzle to be solved but a 
      divine reality to be adored. It shows us that God is love by nature — a communion of 
      Persons eternally giving and receiving love. As human beings made in God's image, we are 
      invited into this Trinitarian life through grace, worship, and charity.</p>

      <h3>Why does the Catholic Church venerate Mary?</h3>
      <p>The Catholic Church venerates the Blessed Virgin Mary not as another God but as a special 
      human being in our history. She is the Mother of God (Jesus) and was the first disciple of 
      Jesus Christ. This veneration is called *hyperdulia* in Latin. It is distinct from *latria*, 
      which is reserved for God alone. This devotion is deeply rooted in Scripture: the Angel 
      Gabriel greets Mary as "Full of Grace" (Luke 1:28), and Elizabeth calls her “blessed among 
      women” (Luke 1:42). Most profoundly, Mary herself proclaims, “All generations shall call me 
      blessed” (Luke 1:48), foreseeing the Church's ongoing reverence. Her total obedience to God’s 
      will, especially in accepting to be the Mother of the Savior, places her at the heart of 
      salvation history as the new Eve whose yes undid Eve's no.

      Throughout Church Tradition, from the writings of early Church Fathers like St. Irenaeus and 
      St. Athanasius to the declarations of Ecumenical Councils, Mary has been acknowledged as a 
      unique instrument of grace. She is not worshipped, but honored as the spiritual Mother of all 
      Christians (cf. John 19:26–27) and the perfect model of faith and humility. Marian doctrines 
      like the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption underscore her special role in God's plan, 
      always pointing us to Christ. Devotions like the Rosary, Marian feasts, and pilgrimages are 
      not ends in themselves but lead the faithful into a deeper relationship with Jesus, through 
      the one who knew Him most intimately. </p>
